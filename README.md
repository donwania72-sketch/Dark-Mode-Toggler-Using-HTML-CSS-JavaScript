# Dark Mode Toggler Using HTML, CSS & JavaScript

## Project Name

**Smart Dark Mode Toggler**

## Description

Smart Dark Mode Toggler is a simple and user-friendly feature built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. It allows users to switch between **light mode** and **dark mode** with a single click. The toggler improves user experience by reducing eye strain and giving users control over the website’s appearance.

## Features

* One-click light/dark mode switch
* Smooth and clean UI
* Improves readability and user comfort
* Pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (no libraries)
* Beginner-friendly and easy to customize

## Technologies Used

* **HTML** – Structure of the toggle button and page
* **CSS** – Styling for light and dark themes
* **JavaScript** – Logic for switching themes

## How It Works

JavaScript listens for a click event on the toggle button. When clicked, it adds or removes a CSS class (e.g., `dark-mode`) from the body. This class changes colors, background, and text styles to switch between light and dark modes.

## File Structure

```
/dark-mode-toggler
│── index.html
│── style.css
│── script.js
│── README.md
```

## How to Use

1. Download or clone the project.
2. Open `index.html` in any modern browser.
3. Click the toggle button to switch between light and dark mode.

## Customization

* Change colors and themes in `style.css`.
* Modify toggle behavior or animations in `script.js`.
* You can add icons (sun/moon) for better UI.

## Learning Outcome

* DOM manipulation using JavaScript
* Using CSS classes dynamically
* Improving UI/UX with theme switching
* Writing clean and reusable code
